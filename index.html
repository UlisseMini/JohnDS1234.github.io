<p>Hello I am Aareyan Manzoor(I go by JohnDS online), a 2nd year undergrad at ASU. I am a student and lover of math, and this website is for me to share my love of math.My goal is to be a polymath for math, I am interested in learning in depth pretty much all fields of math(and beyond for applications too). I think the beauty of math lies in the interplay between different ideas in different fields, which is why I want to learn a lot of diverse things. My postings on the blog will probably have a lot of nice results that lie in the intersection of fields as a result.</p>

<p>I will have a section for my blog, where I will post about interesting results I know. This could be anything I feel is worth sharing due to how nice the proof or the result is. I will also have a section where I upload typed up solutions to problems from books I am reading. I sometimes do this to organize my proofs and also as a way to ensure I am doing the problems of a book.</p>

<p>If you wanna hangout with me you can find me on my discord: JohnDegen@1149 or on the discord math server(just search this and you will find it). </p>
